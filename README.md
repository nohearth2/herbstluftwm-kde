# herbstluftwm-kde
If your wanting to run herbstluftwm  with kde give this a try

Note this not for Wayland  this only support xorg 


my systeam 
Arch linux - arcolinux 
KDE Plasma 5
KWin 
Kerbstulftwm 


this for plasma 5   if you for plamsa 4 you have to do your self 

other note Think like D-menu work along with the kde menu 
keybinding in kerbstluftwm work with in kde now 
this file dose not dose not come with kerbstluftwm config file 
the config file im useing is the from acro-linux for kerbstluftwm   





this just a X-seeseon that let you  use both kerbstluftwm  and kde togther 

place the new X-seeson filre in /usr/share/xsessions 

you can download the github file and cp in your /usr/share/xsessions 
by useing  cp your  download fiel path to /usr/share/xsessions  
 
 

Note there has been no change to config file  that come with from herbstluftwm for 


this still need testing i think config file herstilftwn can be change ![2021-08-02_20-05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5195657/127941745-f0bfb052-a633-4431-8ca4-50a29b9cb2dc.png)
